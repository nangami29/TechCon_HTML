            <h3>History of Techcon</h3>
            <p>
                SRC has a rich history of success. Since 1982, SRC has funded more than $2.5B in research, built a semiconductor workforce by sponsoring more than 16,000 graduate students, and provided over 890 patents to member companies. 

For almost 40 years, SRC and its members have assembled the best university researchers while educating an elite workforce of talented graduate students—in science, engineering, and technology. SRC graduates accrue a competitive advantage over their non-SRC counterparts, and SRC member organizations secure early access to an expanding set of solutions addressing their deepest technical challenges.
